# homero-java-sample | English - [PortuguÃªs](README-pt.md)
Simple project made in Netbeans 8.2 as schoolwork during my IT course of IFSP.
The idea was to represent fictional sales in video game industry using charts.
To do this, I used [JFreeCharts](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) and [Synthetica](http://www.jyloo.com/synthetica/) for the look and feel of Swing.

Some screenshots of the project:
