# homero-java-sample
Simple project made in Netbeans 8.2 as schoolwork during my IT course of IFSP.
The idea was to represent fictional sales in video game industry using charts.
To do this, i used [JFreeCharts](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) and [Synthetica](http://www.jyloo.com/synthetica/) for the look and feel of Swing.
